# Effect-of-Government-Response-on-the-Number-of-Infected-Individuals-by-Covid-19
This study aims to understand the relationship between the most recent cumulative number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in different countries, per 10,000 individuals (on the 23rd of October 2020), with the past government responses in these countries to the outbreak (set on the 15th of June 2020). A model will be constructed to depict this relationship.

This is a group project done by myself (Catherine Al Aswad), in addition to Ali Alhakeem, Uyen Dao, and Long Kim Long.
